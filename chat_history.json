You want to create a React Native app with Expo that delivers personalized Bible verses to users throughout the day. Here's a plan to achieve this:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **User Input Screens:**\n    *   A screen to ask the user for a \"topic\" they're interested in.\n    *   A screen to ask the user for the \"number of messages per day\" they want to receive.\n*   **Message Delivery:**\n    *   Implement the logic to fetch a relevant Bible verse (NIV version) based on the user's chosen topic.\n    *   Rephrase the verse as a direct message from God to the user.\n    *   Schedule these messages to be delivered at random intervals throughout the day, respecting the user's specified message limit.\n*   **Settings Screen:**\n    *   A screen where users can adjust their topic and the number of messages per day.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#2E8B57` (Sea Green)\n    *   Secondary: `#BDB76B` (Khaki)\n    *   Accent: `#A0522D` (Sienna)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E9967A` (Dark Salmon)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern and clean font like \"System\", \"Roboto\", or \"Open Sans\" for readability.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Create Input Screens:**\n    *   Create new screens or modify existing ones (like the home screen) to collect the \"topic\" and \"number of messages per day\" from the user. Store this information using a state management solution (e.g., React Context, Zustand, or Recoil).\n2.  **Implement Verse Fetching and Rephrasing:**\n    *   Research and integrate an API or library that provides access to the NIV Bible.\n    *   Create a function that takes the user's topic and fetches a relevant verse.\n    *   Implement logic to rephrase the verse as a message from God to the user. This might involve using regular expressions or a more sophisticated NLP technique.\n3.  **Schedule Message Delivery:**\n    *   Use `expo-notifications` to schedule local notifications.\n    *   Implement a function that calculates random intervals throughout the day and schedules the delivery of the rephrased Bible verses.\n4.  **Create Settings Screen:**\n    *   Create a settings screen where users can modify their topic and message frequency.\n    *   Update the stored user preferences and reschedule the notifications accordingly.\n5.  **Remove Demo Content:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it's no longer needed.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement this plan.\n\n**Instructions for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  Implement the plan described above to create a React Native app that delivers personalized Bible verses to users.\n2.  Modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n3.  Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T18:19:20.447237"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching for relevant information about implementing notifications and scheduling in React Native/Expo apps."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me search for information about Bible APIs and AsyncStorage for storing user preferences:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!
